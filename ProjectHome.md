Project includes
  * Hand-made LL1 syntax checker + lexan
  * Hand-made LL1 parse table generation tool. Takes raw grammar as input (production terminals and non-terminals are represented as words of any length)

and a bunch of ~~[testdriven.net](http://www.testdriven.net)~~ Visual Studio 2008 tests.
